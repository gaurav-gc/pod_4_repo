information_about_lakers = 'The Lakers went all in this offseason and swung a deal for former Pelicans forward Anthony Davis.\
 \nThey sent a package of Brandon Ingram, Lonzo Ball, Josh Hart, and 3 first-round picks to New Orleans to land Davis.\
 \nThose three have made good developments with the Pelicans, especially Brandon Ingram.\
 \nBut, the deal is still a huge win for the Lakers as Lebron, Davis, and company have put together an incredible season.\
 \nLos Angeles has ridden James and Davis, along with a supporting cast built around them, to the second-best record in the NBA.\
 \nThe Lakers ended the season atop the Western Conference with a record of 49-14.\
 \nThey were narrowly behind the Bucks for the best record in the league.\
 /nDavis proved to the final piece necessary for the Lakers to rebound from missing the playoff√≠s last year.\
 /nLos Angeles was a dominant club on both sides of the ball and are in a position to have another successful year next season.'
