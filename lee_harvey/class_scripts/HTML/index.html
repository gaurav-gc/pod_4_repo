    <h3>History</h3>
    <p>In 2003 I began my journey into technology by enrolling into Cittone Institute's Network Administration course.  This gave me hands on, as well as conceptual knowledge, of how computers and networking worked.  This experience provided me with certifiations in Hardware and Software (CompTIA A+), Networking (CompTIA Network+) and Microsoft certifications for 2000 Professional and Server, as well as the MCSA (Microsoft Certified Systems Administrator).  This allowed me to begin working as a consultant for several organizations.  I found that I wasn't great at collections and soon got out of consulting altogether.</p>

    <h3>Current</h3>
    <p>Attempting to learn programming on my own wasn't working for me.  I found some of the concepts difficult, even after watching tutorials, reading books on basic and advanced concepts and asking questions on the web, which weren't always kindly accepted.  I heard about JTC through a friend who was also looking into programming.  He didn't apply, but I did and am currently participating in the course.</p>
    <p>This has been an experience in itself.  It has provided the opportunity to assist my classmates in their journey into technology and programming.  This is sort of the same as what I do on the <a href=https://forum.zorin.com>Zorin</a> forum.  This is in addition to performing as a moderator.</p>

    <p>Most of my work is currently in Python, though that is expanding to include HTML.  You can find the code on my <a href="https://github.com/VirtDev337">GitHub</a>.</p>
