    <h1>Brendan's Portfolio</h1>
    <li>Brendan was born in Cameroon, Africa</li>
    <li>Brendan met Kim Kardashian, Common, and Queens of the Stone Age at San Quentin</li>
    <li>Brendan composed a song featured on episode 6 of a YouTube series called That's Not a Thing</li>
    <h2>Background</h2>
    <p>
        Upon Brendan's release from immigration detention, he has been commited to learning how to code and obtaining 
        gainful employment in the Tech industry. However Brendan's passion for programming didn't happen overnight. In 
        fact, Brendan discovered his love for programming while imprisoned at San Quentin State Prison. It was there 
        that he and a Data Scientist volunteering at the institution collaborated to create 
        <a href="https://theprisoncoder.wordpress.com/">theprisoncoder.wordpress.com</a> which is meant to be a place 
        where friends and family of inmates can come to find resources to hone programming skills while incarcerated.
    </p>
    <p>
        Currently Brendan is a fellow at the Justice Through Code bootcamp via Columbia Unversity. Here he is learning 
        the fundamentals of Python, fullstack wed development, and negotiation skills applicable to fiding a job. All 
        of Brendan's work with JTC can be found on <a href="https://github.com/theprisoncoder">his GitHub profile.</a>
